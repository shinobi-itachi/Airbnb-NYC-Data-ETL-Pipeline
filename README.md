# Airbnb-NYC-Data-ETL-Pipeline
This repository contains a Python script to perform an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process on Airbnb NYC listing data using pandas and SQLAlchemy. The script reads the data from a CSV file, creates the necessary database schema in PostgreSQL, loads the data into the database, transforms the data, and loads the transformed data into a new table.
